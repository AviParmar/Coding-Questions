# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

**Each Pull Request sent should comply to this, if somewhat violation is noticed later, it can be labelled as `Invalid` or `Spam`, so, read this carefully.**

# ADDING SOLUTIONS TO EXISTING PROBLEMS:

- Your Problem and Solution should be contained under desired Folder (eg: '"HackerRank Problems/name-of-problem/"' for problem "name-of-problem" from **HackerRank**).
- Each Folder ("name-of-problem") should contain `atleast 2 files`.
- One file preferably named as `problem.md` should contain either `the problem itself` or the `link to the problem`. You should not add anything on your own except the description provided on the website, along with the `constraints`, `sample inputs`, `outputs`, `explaination`.
- The other file should be a `solution.extension` file where ".extension" refers to the programming language in which you are contributing the solution.
- We expect `solution` should be well documented to explain the purpose of the codes.
- You may add `author : your-name` and `link : your-solution-link` as comments in the code.
- Solutions should be `properly indented`.
- You may contribute solutions to as many languages you want.
- Solution should be strictly your own, solutions from other's problems are not accepted and will be marked invalid if we find evidence.

# ADDING SOLUTIONS TO NEW PROBLEMS:

- Your Problem and Solution should be contained under desired Folder (eg: `"Miscellaneous/name-of-problem/"` for problem "name-of-problem")
- Each Folder ("name-of-problem") should contain `atleast 2 files`.
- One file preferably named as `problem.md` should contain the complete description of your problem, along with the `constraints`, `sample inputs`, `outputs`, `explaination` and if required `illustrations`.
- At least `2 test-cases` should be there.
- The other file should be a `solution.extension` file where ".extension" refers to the programming language in which you are contributing the solution.
- We expect `solution` should be well documented to explain the purpose of the codes.
- Solutions should be `properly indented`.
- You may contribute solutions to as many languages you want.
- New Problem contributed should be strictly your own, we respect authencity, and hope to receive original problems and solutions from your end.

# DOCUMENTATION CONTRIBUTION:

You may contribute to the README or any of the documentation files if you want to improve it. We will be happy to update useful changes.

# IMPORTANT POINTS BEFORE SENDING PULL REQUESTS:

- Your `Solution` should be strictly in the `"solution.extension"` file, not in the `problem.md` file
- Maintainers should be able to update changes.
- The `problem.md` should not include any **LOGIC or IDEA** for solving the problem.
- **More emphasis is given on understanding the logic used to get the solution rather than the code itself**. Hence simply copy-pasting code is not encouraged.
- Authenticity is expected and respected for every PULL REQUEST(s).

**You can expect your PR(s) to get merged if you follow the points and we expect alot of contributions from your end to make this repository a powerful one, raising the standards!!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ”¥**

**Happy Contributing DEVs** :wink:
